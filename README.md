## How does it work?
The installer should automatically list installed Unity games found in your Steam library.

If the game you're trying to mod isn't listed, you can locate it manually by clicking on the `Add Game Manually` button.

To install MelonLoader, click on the game you wish to mod. Next, select your preferred version and hit the big `Install` button.

### Nightly builds
> *We strongly advise against enabling Nightly builds unless you know what you're doing.*

Nightly builds are bleeding-edge builds, generated right after any changes are made to the project. They can be enabled with the switch under the version selection menu.

## Compilation
The project can be compiled using the .NET 8.0 compiler.<br>
To create a single-file build, use the `dotnet publish` command in the repository's root directory.
